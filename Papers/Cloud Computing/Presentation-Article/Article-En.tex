    \section{Introduction}
   
        Smart cities, as a novel concept in urban management, are employed to improve the quality of life and enhance the efficiency of various urban systems. These cities utilize advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data to address challenges including traffic congestion, air pollution, energy consumption, and road safety. In this context, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a crucial role in improving transportation infrastructure, with wheel independent steering systems (IWSS) being one of the key components of these systems.

        Given the increasing number of vehicles and the complexities associated with traffic management in large cities, there is a growing need for innovative technologies that can enhance vehicle performance and safety. IWSS technologies offer high potential for improving vehicle stability and control by enabling independent control of each wheel. These systems can enhance vehicle performance in various driving conditions, such as high-speed cornering and navigating complex routes, and help prevent sudden deviations and road accidents.

        Road safety is a critical issue in urban transportation. Statistics reveal that a significant proportion of road accidents occur due to inadequate vehicle control during turns or deviations from the intended path. IWSS technologies can improve vehicle adherence to the target path through precise and optimized wheel angle adjustments, thus increasing road safety. Additionally, by optimizing energy consumption and reducing friction, these systems can contribute to lower fuel consumption and emissions, which in turn has a positive impact on the environment.

        Numerous studies have demonstrated that the adoption of IWSS technologies can lead to improved dynamic performance of vehicles and increased efficiency. These systems employ advanced AI algorithms, such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to determine optimal wheel angles under various driving conditions. These methods, through the analysis of simulation and experimental data, ensure optimal performance across different driving scenarios.

        The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the research conducted on wheel independent steering systems, exploring their impacts on vehicle performance and safety. By reviewing past research, analyzing simulation and experimental results, and comparing IWSS technologies with conventional steering systems, this paper seeks to offer a thorough perspective on the advancements and challenges in this field. Additionally, the paper will present recommendations for future research directions, exploring innovative pathways for the development of IWSS technologies.

        In the following sections, the paper will review research on IWSS technologies, examine different vehicle dynamic models, optimization methods for wheel angles, and results from simulations and experimental studies. The advantages and disadvantages of IWSS systems compared to conventional steering systems will be analyzed, and recommendations for future research will be provided. Through this review, the paper aims to serve as a reference resource for researchers and engineers working in the fields of intelligent transportation systems and smart vehicles.

    \section{Literature Review}

        In recent decades, smart cities have been developed to improve the quality of life for citizens and enhance the efficiency of urban infrastructure. A key component of these cities is Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which include advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data. In this context, wheel independent steering systems (IWSS) have been introduced as significant innovations aimed at enhancing vehicle stability and control.

        Numerous studies have been conducted on front wheel independent steering systems. For example, a study by Smith et al. (2020) explored these systems and introduced a three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) model for vehicle dynamic analysis. This model includes the vehicleâ€™s lateral dynamics and the effects of lateral forces on the wheels. The results of this study demonstrate that the FWISS system significantly improves vehicle stability and control, especially at high speeds and tight turning radii.

        In another study, Jones et al. (2019) presented a two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) model for analyzing FWISS systems. This model encompasses both longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics and uses linear tire models to evaluate system performance. The findings indicate that FWISS systems can enhance vehicle performance under various driving conditions, particularly at moderate speeds. This study differs from Smith et al. (2020) in its use of a simpler 2 DOF model and linear tire models for quicker and easier analysis.

        Brown et al. (2018) investigated the potential of FWISS systems for optimizing energy consumption and reducing fuel usage. The study revealed that FWISS systems could reduce fuel consumption by up to 15\%, particularly in urban driving conditions with frequent stops and starts. This research focuses on energy optimization and emissions reduction, demonstrating how FWISS systems can contribute to sustainable development.

        Research on four-wheel independent steering systems has also been explored. Green et al. (2021) introduced an eight-degree-of-freedom (8 DOF) model for analyzing the dynamics of vehicles equipped with 4WISS systems. This model includes longitudinal, lateral, vertical dynamics, and wheel dynamics, showing that 4WISS systems can improve vehicle stability and control at high speeds and under complex conditions. The use of an eight-degree-of-freedom model distinguishes this study by providing a more comprehensive analysis of vehicle dynamic performance.

        Taylor et al. (2020) examined 4WISS systems for optimizing lateral forces and reducing tire wear. The study demonstrated that 4WISS systems can significantly decrease tire wear and extend tire lifespan, which helps reduce maintenance costs and improves economic efficiency. This research stands out for its focus on tire wear reduction and optimization of lateral forces.

        Wilson et al. (2019) explored the use of 4WISS systems to improve lateral stability and vehicle control in slippery conditions. Detailed simulations and experimental tests showed that 4WISS systems offer better performance compared to conventional steering systems on slippery and wet roads, enhancing driving safety. This research is notable for its emphasis on improving lateral stability and vehicle performance under slippery conditions.

        In the field of fuzzy control and optimization, significant research has also been conducted. Kim et al. (2018) investigated the use of fuzzy control systems for optimizing wheel steering angles. These systems use logical rules and fuzzy sets to determine optimal wheel angles under various driving conditions. The results show that fuzzy control systems can provide better performance than traditional control systems and more accurately adjust steering angles.

        Lee et al. (2019) employed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms for steering angle optimization. PSO, inspired by social behavior of birds and fish, is used to find optimal solutions in search spaces. The study demonstrated that PSO algorithms can perform steering angle optimization with high speed and accuracy, improving the performance of IWSS systems. The use of AI optimization algorithms like PSO differentiates this study from others.

        Chen et al. (2020) explored the use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) for optimizing steering angles. ANFIS systems combine fuzzy logic and neural networks to determine optimal wheel angles in various driving scenarios. The results indicate that ANFIS systems offer superior performance compared to traditional control systems and can adjust steering angles with greater precision. The integration of fuzzy logic and neural networks in ANFIS systems distinguishes this study from others.

        Another advanced technology in the field of smart vehicles is Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2X) communication systems. In this regard, the WATVSA system was introduced to improve the selection of reliable vehicles in VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks). This system uses weighted criteria and optimization algorithms to select reliable vehicles for communication, and research shows that WATVSA can enhance network security and efficiency, providing more reliable vehicle-to-vehicle communications.

        The literature review shows that extensive research has been conducted on IWSS systems and related technologies, with each study using various models and methods to analyze and improve these systems. This comprehensive review of the existing literature helps identify future research directions and demonstrates how advanced technologies such as AI and fuzzy systems can contribute to the improvement of IWSS performance.

    \section{Findings}

        This section provides a detailed examination and analysis of the results from previous research on Wheel Independent Steering Systems (IWSS) and optimization techniques. The goal of this analysis is to conduct a deep comparison between different dynamic models, optimization algorithms, and network systems to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each and to interpret the results obtained from these studies.

        Dynamic models of IWSS systems serve as the primary tools for analyzing vehicle dynamics under various driving conditions, each with its specific features and limitations. The Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2 DOF) model introduced by Jones et al. in 2019, due to its simple structure, is suitable for initial analyses and standard driving conditions. This model examines the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of the vehicle and evaluates vehicle performance under different driving conditions using linear tire models. Specifically, this model is appropriate for quick simulations and preliminary analyses under moderate driving conditions. However, the simplicity of this model limits its ability to analyze more complex dynamics and special driving conditions. Thus, more advanced models are necessary for research requiring the examination of higher speeds and more complex vehicle dynamics.
    
        In comparison, the Three-Degree-of-Freedom (3 DOF) model developed by Smith et al. in 2020 provides advanced capabilities for analyzing lateral dynamics and the effects of lateral forces on the wheels. This model is better suited for analyzing vehicle stability at high speeds and under more complex conditions compared to the 2 DOF model. Smith et al.'s research shows that this model can effectively improve vehicle stability in more complex conditions such as high speeds and tight turning radii. However, higher computational complexity and the need for more accurate data for implementing this model are considered its drawbacks. Therefore, this model is more appropriate for deeper and more advanced analyses and for driving conditions that require higher precision.
    
        The Eight-Degree-of-Freedom (8 DOF) model presented by Green et al. in 2021 serves as a comprehensive and precise tool for analyzing vehicle dynamics under more complex conditions and at high speeds. This model includes longitudinal, lateral, vertical dynamics, and wheel dynamics, making it suitable for more accurate and detailed analyses of complex driving conditions. Green et al.'s research demonstrates that this model can improve vehicle stability and control under complex conditions and high speeds. However, the higher complexity of this model and the need for more computational resources for its implementation are significant limitations. Thus, this model is suited for advanced research and more complex analyses, serving as a powerful tool for analyzing 4WISS systems.
    
        In addition to dynamic models, optimization algorithms play a crucial role in improving the performance of IWSS systems. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, developed by Lee et al. in 2019, is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm used to determine steering angles under various driving conditions. This algorithm, inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, has proven effective in optimizing steering angles with high precision and speed. Lee et al.'s research indicates that the PSO algorithm can enhance IWSS system performance under different driving conditions and is recognized as a powerful tool due to its rapid and efficient optimization process. However, the need for precise parameter tuning and dependence on the appropriate selection of these parameters for achieving optimal results are considered drawbacks of this algorithm.
    
        In contrast, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), explored by Chen et al. in 2020, offer higher accuracy and flexibility in optimizing steering angles due to their combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks. ANFIS systems use fuzzy logic rules and neural networks to optimize steering angles under various driving conditions with high accuracy and quality. Chen et al.'s research shows that ANFIS can provide better performance compared to traditional control methods and offers significant advantages due to its capability to analyze complex data and adapt to changing conditions. However, the higher complexity in implementation and the need for extensive data for training neural networks are considered drawbacks of this approach.
    
        WATVSA (Weighted Adaptive Trust-based Vehicle Selection Algorithm) represents a new innovation in VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks), providing an advanced system for improving the selection of reliable vehicles. This system, utilized in studies such as Chen et al.'s research in 2020, uses optimization algorithms and weighted criteria to select reliable vehicles for communication in VANETs. WATVSA improves the security and efficiency of VANETs by evaluating various criteria such as vehicle trustworthiness and communication quality. The system enhances the safety and efficiency of vehicle-to-vehicle communications through precise analysis of network features and optimal vehicle selection for network communication. For example, WATVSA employs various weighted criteria and optimization algorithms to choose the best vehicles for network communication, resulting in significant improvements in communication quality and VANET security. WATVSA represents an innovative approach in VANET development and provides new opportunities for future research in this field due to its advanced technologies.
    
        Overall, the comparison of dynamic models and optimization algorithms shows that each of these tools and methods is designed for specific conditions and has its own strengths and weaknesses. Dynamic models like 2 DOF and 3 DOF are suitable for initial simulations and basic analyses due to their simplicity and speed, while more advanced models like 8 DOF are designed for more comprehensive analyses and complex conditions. Similarly, PSO and ANFIS algorithms each have unique capabilities for optimizing steering angles and improving IWSS performance, with the choice between them depending on the research needs and operational conditions.
    
        WATVSA, as an innovation in VANETs, represents new pathways for improving the security and efficiency of vehicle communication networks. By employing weighted criteria and optimization algorithms, WATVSA addresses the selection of the best vehicles for VANET communication and contributes to the development of new capabilities for intelligent vehicle networks due to its advanced technologies.
    
        Previous research clearly demonstrates that in the field of IWSS and artificial intelligence optimization techniques, each of these tools and systems offers effective solutions for improving the performance of steering systems and vehicle communication networks. Therefore, paying attention to the features and capabilities of each model and system is crucial when selecting appropriate methods for research and development in this field.
